# European-Exchange-Rates
A short project examining the exchange rates of different european countries over time

This is a short project focused on data visualization. We'll use financial market data to create an infographic summarizing the similarities and differences between the impacts of the Great Financial Crisis (c. 2008) and the COVID pandemic (c.2020) on Euro-to-Dollar Foreign Exchange rates. First we load in the data, slice out the part of the data pertaining to the GFC and COVID-19 pandemic, and then use it to create the infographic.
